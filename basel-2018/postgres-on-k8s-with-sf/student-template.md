# Provision PostgreSQL on Kubernetes cluster using Service Fabrik

## Introduction
In this lab paticipants will pull the pre-implemented code for Kubernetes provisioner from GitHub. They will integrate the code and will experience the ease with which a new backing service provisioner can be integrated with [Service Fabrik](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/service-fabrik-broker). Later they will use the same to provision a PostgreSQL instance on [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/)

## Learning Objectives
In this lab participant with learn
1. Ease with which they can bring there own components into Service Fabrik
2. Experience PosgreSQL provisioning on Kubernetes Cluster

## Prerequisites
1. Basic understanding of CF ecosystem for example creating a service instance, binding a service instance with an app
