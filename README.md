#### Questions

* Which open source license should we be using for this material?  Does the Foundation care which license we use?

    NAA - I was thinking the MIT License

#### FYI

Norman Abramovitz

  * I have been using README.md to keep some notes.  I am expecting those files (including this one) will change to a high level descriptions.
