# Summit hands-on labs

Welcome to the Hands-on Labs for CF Summit Boston '18!

If you're seeing this, then you're already in the Google Cloud Shell.  This file is open in your IDE.  To your left is a file browser with all of the files for all of the hands-on labs.  Below you is a terminal that has the `cf`, `gcloud` and other tools pre-installed.

If this is your first time loading this cloud shell, then you can clear out any changes the previous student might have made by running:

```
$ nuke
```

Hope you enjoy the lab and take some knowledge home with you!
