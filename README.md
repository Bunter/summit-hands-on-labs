# Summit hands-on labs

Welcome to the Hands-on Labs for CF Summit Boston '18!

If you're seeing this, then you're already in the Google Cloud Shell.  This file is open in your IDE.  To your left is a file browser with all of the files for all of the hands-on labs.  Below you is a terminal that has the `cf`, `gcloud` and other tools pre-installed.

If this is your first time loading this cloud shell, then you can clear out any changes the previous student might have made by running:

```
$ nuke
```

Hope you enjoy the lab and take some knowledge home with you!


If you log into https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor
as `training.hol.N` (where N is 1-12), password `cfsummith0l`, then
you’ll be sitting at an IDE and a terminal with a home directory 
backed by our git repo.  Feel free to change the README (which the IDE 
kindly shows by default), or the `.bashrc`, etc files to suit your needs.
The latest `cf` is installed, and there’s a `./scripts/nuke` script 
which removes all local changes.
